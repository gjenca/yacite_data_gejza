Abstract = {{We define the torsion element in effect algebras and use it to
   characterize MV-effect algebra and 0-homogeneous effect algebras in
   chain-complete effect algebras. As an application, we prove that every
   element of an orthocomplete homogeneous atomic effect algebra has a
   unique basic decomposition into a sum of a sharp element and unsharp
   multiples of atoms. Further, we characterize homogeneity by the set of
   all sharp elements in orthocomplete atomic effect algebras.}},

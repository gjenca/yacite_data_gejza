Abstract = {{An effect algebra (EA) is a partial algebraic structure, originally
   formulated as an algebraic base for unsharp quantum measurements. The
   class of EAs includes, as special cases, several partially ordered
   algebraic structures, including orthomodular lattices (OMLs) and
   orthomodular posets (OMPs), hitherto used as mathematical models for
   experimentally verifiable propositions pertaining to physical systems.
   Moreover, MV-algebras, which are mathematical models for many-valued
   logics, are special cases of EAs. The present paper studies
   generalizations to EAs of the hull mapping featured in L. Loomis's
   dimension theory for complete OMLs and develops a theory of direct
   decomposition for EAs with a hull mapping. A. Sherstnev and V. Kalinin
   have extended Loomis's dimension theory to orthocomplete OMPs, and here
   it is further extended to orthocomplete EAs; moreover, a corresponding
   direct decomposition into types I, II, and III is obtained using the
   hull mapping induced by the dimension equivalence relation. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Generalizations of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem have been proved for
   different types of algebras, starting from sigma-complete orthomodular
   lattices and sigma-complete MV-algebras and continuing with more general
   structures, including (pseudo) effect algebras and (pseudo)
   BCK-algebras. E.g., for sigma-complete MV-algebras a version of the
   Cantor-Bernstein theorem has been proved which assumes that the bounds
   of isomorphic intervals are boolean.
   There is another direction of research which has been paid less
   attention. We ask which algebras satisfy the Cantor-Bernstein theorem in
   the same form as for a-complete boolean algebras, without any additional
   assumption. In the case of orthomodular lattices, it has been proved
   that this class is rather large. E.g., every orthomodular lattice can be
   embedded as a subalgebra or expressed as an epimorphic image of a member
   of this class. On the other hand, also the complement of this class is
   large in the same sense. We study the analogous question for MV-algebras
   and we find out interesting examples of MV-algebras which possess or do
   not possess this property. This contributes to the investigations of the

Title = {{The Complete Dimension Theory of Partially Ordered Systems with

Abstract = {{We develop dimension theory for a large class of structures of the form
   (L, <=, perpendicular to, similar to), where (L <=) is a partially
   ordered set, perpendicular to is a binary relation on L, and similar to
   is an equivalence relation on L, subject to certain axioms. We call
   these structures espaliers. For x, y, z is an element of L, we say that
   z = x circle plus y holds, if x perpendicular to y and z is the supremum
   of \{x, y\}. The dimension theory of L is the universal similar
   to-invariant homomorphism from (L, circle plus, 0) to a partial
   commutative monoid S. We say that S is the dimension range of L.
   Particular examples of espaliers are the following:
   (i) Let B be a complete Boolean algebra. For x, y is an element of B, we
   say that x perpendicular to y if x boolean AND y = 0, and we take
   similar to to be any zero-separating, unrestrictedly additive and
   refining equivalence relation on B (for instance, equality).
   (ii) Let R be a right self-injective von Neumann regular ring. We denote
   by L the lattice of all direct summands of a given nonsingular injective
   right R-module, for instance, the lattice of finitely generated right
   ideals of R. ForA, B is an element of L, we say that A perpendicular to
   B if A boolean AND B= \{0\}, and A similar to B if A congruent to B.
   (iii) More generally, let L be a complete, meet-continuous,
   complemented, modular lattice. For x, y is an element of L, we say that
   x perpendicular to y if x boolean AND y = 0, and x similar to y if x and
   y are projective by (finite) decomposition.
   (iv) Let A be an AW{*}-algebra. We denote by L the lattice of
   projections of A, and take the standard orthogonality and equivalence
   relations on L. For p, q is an element of L, then, p perpendicular to q
   if pq = 0, and p similar to q if p and q are Murray von Neumann
   equivalent, that is, there exists x is an element of A such that p =
   x{*}x and q = xx{*}.
   We prove that the dimension range of any espalier (L, <=, perpendicular
   to, similar to) is a lower interval of a commutative monoid of the form
   C (Omega(I), Z(gamma)) x C (Omega(II), R-gamma) x C (Omega(III),
   2(gamma)), ({*})
   where Omega(I), Omega(II), and Omega(III) are complete Boolean spaces,
   and where we put
   Z(gamma) = Z(+) boolean OR \{N-xi | 0 <= xi <= gamma\},
   R-gamma = R+ boolean OR \{N-xi | 0 <= xi <= gamma\},
   2(gamma) = \{0\} boolean OR \{N-xi | 0 <= xi <= gamma\},
   endowed with their interval topology and natural addition operations,
   for every ordinal gamma. Conversely, we prove that every lower interval
   of a monoid of the form ({*}) can be represented as the dimension range
   of an espalier arising from each of the contexts (i)-(iv) above. The
   context of W{*}-algebras requires the spaces Omega(I), Omega(II), and
   Omega(III) to be hyperstonian, and no further restriction is needed.
   This subsumes many earlier dimension-theoretic results, and, in
   applications, completes theories developed for examples such as (i)-(iv)
   above.}},

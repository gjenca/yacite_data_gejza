Abstract = {{Pseudo-effect algebras are partial algebras (E; +, 0, 1) with a
   partially defined addition + which is not necessary commutative and with
   two complements, left and right ones. We define central elements of a
   pseudo-effect algebra and the centre, which in the case of MV-algebras
   coincides with the set of Boolean elements and in the case of effect
   algebras with the Riesz decomposition property central elements are only
   characteristic elements. If E satisfies general comparability, then E is
   a pseudo MV-algebra. Finally, we apply central elements to obtain a
   variation of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem for pseudo-effect algebras.}},

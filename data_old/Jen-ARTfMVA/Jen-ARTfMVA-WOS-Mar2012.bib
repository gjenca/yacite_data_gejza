Abstract = {{An MV-pair is a BG-pair (B; G) (where B is a Boolean algebra and G is a
   subgroup of the automorphism group of B) satisfying certain conditions.
   Recently, it was proved by Jenca that, given an MV-pair (B; G), the
   quotient (B/similar to(G)), where (similar to(G)), is an equivalence
   relation naturally associated with G, is an MV-algebra, and conversely,
   to every MV-algebra there corresponds an MV-pair. In this paper, we
   introduce a new definition of so called MV{*}-pair, and we show that
   (B/similar to(G)), is an effect algebra iff the first of the defining
   properties of the MV{*}-pair is satisfied, while the second property
   guarantees the MV-algebra structure of (B/similar to(G)). We also study
   some relations between states on MV-algebras and the corresponding
   R-generated Boolean algebras.}},

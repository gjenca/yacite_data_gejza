Abstract = {{An MV-pair is a BG-pair (B; G) (where B is a Boolean algebra and G is a
   subgroup of the automorphism group of B) satisfying certain conditions.
   Recently, it was proved by Jenca that, given an MV-pair (B; G), the
   quotient (B/similar to(G)), where (similar to(G)), is an equivalence
   relation naturally associated with G, is an MV-algebra, and conversely,
   to every MV-algebra there corresponds an MV-pair. In this paper, we
   introduce a new definition of so called MV{*}-pair, and we show that
   (B/similar to(G)), is an effect algebra iff the first of the defining
   properties of the MV{*}-pair is satisfied, while the second property
   guarantees the MV-algebra structure of (B/similar to(G)). We also study
   some relations between states on MV-algebras and the corresponding
   R-generated Boolean algebras.}},

Abstract = {{Any MV-algebra M can be embedded as a lattice in the Boolean algebra
   B(M) that is R-generated by M. We relate the study of states on an
   MV-algebra M to the study of finitely additive probabilities on B(M). In
   particular, we show that each state on M can be uniquely extended to a
   finitely additive probability on B(M). In case that M is a PMV-algebra,
   the conditional state s(a vertical bar b)defined for a, b is an element
   of M with s(b) not equal 0 is extended to the classical conditional
   probability p(a . b vertical bar b) on B(M) of the a-proportion of the
   event b, given the event b.}},

Abstract = {{Residuated lattices and lattice effect algebras arose in two rather
   different fields. In this paper, by introducing two partial operations
   in effect algebras, we investigate the mutual relationship between
   involutive residuated lattices and lattice effect algebras. We prove
   that a lattice effect algebra under certain conditions can be extended
   to an involutive residuated lattice and the latter with certain
   properties can be restricted to the former. Especially, an sufficient
   and necessary condition for an involutive residuated lattice to be a
   lattice effect algebra with the Riesz decomposition property is
   obtained. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

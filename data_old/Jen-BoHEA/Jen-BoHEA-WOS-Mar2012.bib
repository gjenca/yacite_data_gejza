Abstract = {{We define the torsion element in effect algebras and use it to
   characterize MV-effect algebra and 0-homogeneous effect algebras in
   chain-complete effect algebras. As an application, we prove that every
   element of an orthocomplete homogeneous atomic effect algebra has a
   unique basic decomposition into a sum of a sharp element and unsharp
   multiples of atoms. Further, we characterize homogeneity by the set of
   all sharp elements in orthocomplete atomic effect algebras.}},

Abstract = {{We show that quotients of generalized effect algebras by Riesz ideals
   preserve some important special properties, e.g., homogeneity and
   hereditary Riesz decomposition properties; moreover, quotients of
   generalized orthoalgebras, weak generalized orthomodular posets,
   generalized orthomodular lattices and generalized MV-algebras with
   respect to Riesz ideals belong to the same class. We give a necessary
   and sufficient condition under which a Riesz ideal 1 of a generalized
   effect algebra P is a Riesz ideal also in the unitization E of P. We
   also study relations between Riesz ideals and central elements in GEAs
   and in their unitizations. In the last section, we demonstrate the
   notion of Riesz ideals by some illustrative examples.}},

   algebras and every generalized homogeneous effect algebra is a union of
   its maximal sub-generalized effect algebras with hereditary Riesz

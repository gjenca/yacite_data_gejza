Abstract = {{Elements of the exocenter of a generalized effect algebra (GEA)
   correspond to decompositions of the GEA as a direct sum and thus the
   exocenter is a generalization to GEAs of the center of an effect
   algebra. The exocenter of a GEA is shown to be a boolean algebra, and
   the notion of a hull mapping for an effect algebra is generalized to a
   hull system for a GEA. We study Dedekind orthocompleteness of GEAs and
   extend to GEAs the notion of a centrally orthocomplete effect algebra.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we thoroughly study the set of
   meager elements M(E), the center C(E) and the compatibility center B(E)
   in the setting of atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras E. The main
   result is that in this case the center C(E) is bifull (atomic) iff the
   compatibility center B(E) is bifull (atomic) whenever E is sharply
   dominating. As a by-product, we give a new description of the smallest
   sharp element over x is an element of E via the basic decomposition of
   x: Second, we prove the Triple Representation Theorem for sharply
   dominating atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras.}},

Abstract = {{We define the torsion element in effect algebras and use it to
   characterize MV-effect algebra and 0-homogeneous effect algebras in
   chain-complete effect algebras. As an application, we prove that every
   element of an orthocomplete homogeneous atomic effect algebra has a
   unique basic decomposition into a sum of a sharp element and unsharp
   multiples of atoms. Further, we characterize homogeneity by the set of
   all sharp elements in orthocomplete atomic effect algebras.}},

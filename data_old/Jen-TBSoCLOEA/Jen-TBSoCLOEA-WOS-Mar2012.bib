Abstract = {{We show that the quotient of a dimension effect algebra by its dimension
   equivalence relation is a unital bounded lattice-ordered positive
   partial abelian monoid that satisfies a version of the Riesz
   decomposition property. For a dimension effect algebra of finite type,
   the quotient is a centrally orthocomplete Stone-Heyting MV-effect
   algebra; moreover, an orthocomplete effect algebra in which equality is
   a dimension equivalence relation is the same thing as a complete
   Stone-Heyting MV-effect algebra.}},

Abstract = {{We summarize and extend results about `' small `' quantum structures
   with small dimensions of state spaces. These constructions have
   contributed to the theory of orthomodular lattices. More general quantum
   structures (orthomodular posets, orthoalgebras, and effect algebras)
   admit sometimes simplifications, but there are problems where no
   progress has been achieved.}},

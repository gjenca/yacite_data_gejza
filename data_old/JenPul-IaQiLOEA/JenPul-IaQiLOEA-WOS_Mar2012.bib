Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to congruences and ideals in pseudoeffect
   algebras. Let I be a normal ideal in a pseudoeffect algebra E. We show
   that: (1) the relation similar to (I) induced by I is a congruence if
   and only if for every a is an element of E, I boolean AND {[}0,a] is
   upper directed; (2) the relation similar to (I) induced by I is a strong
   congruence if and only if I is a normal weak Riesz ideal in a
   pseudoeffect algebra E. Moreover, we introduce a stronger concept of
   congruence-namely Riesz strong congruence-and we prove that, if I is a
   normal weak Riesz ideal in a pseudoeffect algebra E, then similar to (I)
   is a Riesz strong congruence and, conversely, if similar to is a Riesz
   strong congruence, then I = {[}0](similar to) is a normal weak Riesz
   ideal, and similar to(I) = similar to.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce the definitions of generalized ideals and
   generalized filters in pseudo effect algebras. From the generalized
   ideals (filters), we obtain some equivalent characterization of ideals
   (filters). The relationships among generalized ideals, ideals and local
   ideals are studied in detail. We also establish an isomorphism between
   the set of supports and the set of generalized ideals of pseudo effect
   algebras.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to a general investigation of congruences and
   ideals in effect algebras. One of our main results is the existence of
   an order isomorphism between Riesz congruences and Riesz ideals. We also
   answer an open question of Dvurecenskij and Pulmannova by showing that

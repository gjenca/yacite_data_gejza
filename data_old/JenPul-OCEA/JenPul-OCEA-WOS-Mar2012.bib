Abstract = {{We define the torsion element in effect algebras and use it to
   characterize MV-effect algebra and 0-homogeneous effect algebras in
   chain-complete effect algebras. As an application, we prove that every
   element of an orthocomplete homogeneous atomic effect algebra has a
   unique basic decomposition into a sum of a sharp element and unsharp
   multiples of atoms. Further, we characterize homogeneity by the set of
   all sharp elements in orthocomplete atomic effect algebras.}},

Abstract = {{We study remarkable sub-lattice effect algebras of Archimedean atomic
   lattice effect algebras E, namely their blocks M, centers C(E),
   compatibility centers B(E) and sets of all sharp elements S(E) of E. We
   show that in every such effect algebra E, every atomic block M and the
   set S(E) are bifull sub-lattice effect algebras of E. Consequently, if E
   is moreover sharply dominating then every atomic block M is again
   sharply dominating and the basic decompositions of elements (BDE of x)
   in E and in M coincide. Thus in the compatibility center B(E) of E,
   nonzero elements are dominated by central elements and their basic
   decompositions coincide with those in all atomic blocks and in E. Some
   further details which may be helpful under answers about the existence
   and properties of states are shown. Namely, we prove the existence of an
   (o)-continuous state on every sharply dominating Archimedean atomic
   lattice effect algebra E with B(E) not equal C(E). Moreover, for
   compactly generated Archimedean lattice effect algebras the equivalence
   of (o)-continuity of states with their complete additivity is proved.
   Further, we prove ``State smearing theorem{''} for these lattice effect
   algebras.}},

Abstract = {{A model of quantum computation is discussed in (Aharanov et al 1997

   (Tarasov 2002 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 5207-35) in which quantum gates
   are represented by quantum operations acting on mixed states. It allows
   one to use a quantum computational model in which connectives of a
   four-valued logic can be realized as quantum gates. In this model, we
   give a representation of certain functions, known as t-norms (Menger
   1942 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 37 57-60), that generalize the triangle
   inequality for the probability distribution-valued metrics. As a
   consequence an interpretation of the standard operations associated with
   the basic fuzzy logic (Hajek 1998 Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic (Trends
   in Logic vol 4) (Dordrecht: Kluwer)) is provided in the frame of quantum
   computation.}},

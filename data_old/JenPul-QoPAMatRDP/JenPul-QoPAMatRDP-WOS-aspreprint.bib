Abstract = {{We systemize a number of algebras that are especially known in the field
   of quantum structures and that in particular arise from the positive
   cones of partially ordered groups. Generalized effect algebras,
   generalized difference posets, cone algebras, commutative BCK-algebras
   with the relative cancellation property, and positive minimal clans are
   included in the text.
   All these structures are conveniently characterizable as special cases
   of generalized pseudoeffect algebras, which we introduced in a previous
   paper. We establish the exact relations between all mentioned
   structures, thereby adding new structures whenever necessary to make the
   scheme of order complete.
   Generalized pseudoeffect algebras were under certain conditions proved
   to be representable by means of a po-group. From this fact, we will
   easily establish representation theorems for all of the structures
   included in discussion.}},

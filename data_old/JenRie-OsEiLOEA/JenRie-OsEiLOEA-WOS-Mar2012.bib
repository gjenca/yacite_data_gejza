Abstract = {{The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we thoroughly study the set of
   meager elements M(E), the center C(E) and the compatibility center B(E)
   in the setting of atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras E. The main
   result is that in this case the center C(E) is bifull (atomic) iff the
   compatibility center B(E) is bifull (atomic) whenever E is sharply
   dominating. As a by-product, we give a new description of the smallest
   sharp element over x is an element of E via the basic decomposition of
   x: Second, we prove the Triple Representation Theorem for sharply
   dominating atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Pages = {{541-559}},
Abstract = {{Effect algebras were introduced as abstract models of the set of quantum
   effects which represent sharp and unsharp properties of physical systems
   and play a basic role in the foundations of quantum mechanics. In the
   present paper, observables on lattice ordered sigma-effect algebras and
   their ``smearings{''} with respect to (weak) Markov kernels are studied.
   It is shown that the range of any observable is contained in a block,
   which is a sigma-MV algebra, and every observable is defined by a
   smearing of a sharp observable, which is obtained from generalized
   Loomis-Sikorski theorem for sigma-MV algebras. Generalized observables
   with the range in the set of sharp real observables arc studied and it
   is shown that they contain all smearings of observables.}},

Abstract = {{If element z of a lattice effect algebra (E, circle plus, 0, 1) is
   central, then the interval {[}0, z] is a lattice effect algebra with the
   new top element z and with inherited partial binary operation circle
   plus. It is a known fact that if the set C(E) of central elements of E
   is an atomic Boolean algebra and the supremum of all atoms of C(E) in E
   equals to the top element of E, then E is isomorphic to a subdirect
   product of irreducible effect algebras ({[}18]). This means that if
   there exists,a MacNeille completion (E) over cap of E which is its
   extension (i.e. E is densely embeddable into (E) over cap) then it is
   possible to embed E into a direct product of irreducible effect
   algebras. Thus E inherits some of the properties of (E) over cap. For
   example, the existence of a state in (E) over cap implies the existence
   of a state in E. In this context, a natural question arises if the
   MacNeille completion of the center of E (denoted as MC(C(E))) is
   necessarily the same as the center of (E) over cap, i.e., if MC(C(E)) =
   C((E) over cap) is necessarily true. We show that the equality is not
   necessarily fulfilled. We find a necessary condition under which the
   equality may hold. Moreover, we show also that even the completeness of
   C(E) and its bifullness in E is not sufficient to guarantee the
   mentioned equality.}},

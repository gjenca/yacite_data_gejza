Abstract = {{The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we thoroughly study the sets of
   meager and hypermeager elements. Second, we study a common
   generalization of orthocomplete and lattice effect algebras. We show
   that every block of an Archimedean homogeneous effect algebra satisfying
   this generalization is lattice ordered. Hence such effect algebras can
   be covered by ranges of observables. As a corollary, this yields that
   every block of a homogeneous orthocomplete effect algebra is lattice
   ordered. Therefore finite homogeneous effect algebras are covered by
   MV-algebras. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our paper is to prove the Triple Representation Theorem,
   which was established by Jenca in the setting of complete lattice effect
   algebras, for a special class of homogeneous effect algebras, namely
   TRT-effect algebras. This class includes complete lattice effect
   algebras, sharply dominating Archimedean atomic lattice effect algebras
   and homogeneous orthocomplete effect algebras.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our paper is twofold. First, we thoroughly study the set of
   meager elements M(E), the center C(E) and the compatibility center B(E)
   in the setting of atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras E. The main
   result is that in this case the center C(E) is bifull (atomic) iff the
   compatibility center B(E) is bifull (atomic) whenever E is sharply
   dominating. As a by-product, we give a new description of the smallest
   sharp element over x is an element of E via the basic decomposition of
   x: Second, we prove the Triple Representation Theorem for sharply
   dominating atomic Archimedean lattice effect algebras.}},

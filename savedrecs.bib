Abstract = {{In this paper, we define and study dimension generalized effect algebras

   generalized effect algebras equipped with a dimension equivalence
   relation. Our theory is a bona fide generalization of the theory of
   dimension effect algebras (DEAs), i.e., it is formulated so that if a
   DGEA happens to be an effect algebra (i.e., it has a unit element), then
   it is a DEA. We prove that a DGEA decomposes into type I, II, and III
   DGEAS in a manner analogous to the type I/II/III decomposition of a DEA.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is devoted to algebraic structures connected with the logic of
   quantum mechanics. Since every (generalized) effect algebra with an
   order determining set of (generalized) states can be represented by
   means of an abelian partially ordered group and events in quantum
   mechanics can be described by positive operators in a suitable Hilbert
   space, we are focused in a representation of partially ordered abelian
   groups by means of sets of suitable linear operators.
   We show that there is a set of points separating a{''}e-maps on a given
   partially ordered abelian group G if and only if there is an injective
   non-trivial homomorphism of G to the symmetric operators on a dense set
   in a complex Hilbert space which is equivalent to an existence of an
   injective non-trivial homomorphism of G into a certain power of a{''}e.
   A similar characterization is derived for an order determining set of
   a{''}e-maps and symmetric operators on a dense set in a complex Hilbert
   space . We also characterize effect algebras with an order determining
   set of states as interval operator effect algebras in groups of
   self-adjoint bounded linear operators.}},

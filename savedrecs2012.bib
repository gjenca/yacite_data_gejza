Abstract = {{An effect algebra is a partial algebraic structure, originally
   formulated as an algebraic base for unsharp quantum measurements. In
   this article we present an approach to the study of lattice effect
   algebras (LEAs) that emphasizes their structure as algebraic models for
   the semantics of (possibly) non-standard symbolic logics. This is
   accomplished by focusing on the interplay among conjunction,
   implication, and negation connectives on LEAs, where the conjunction and
   implication connectives are related by a residuation law. Special cases
   of LEAs are MV-algebras and orthomodular lattices. The main result of
   the paper is a characterization of LEAs in terms of so-called Sasaki
   algebras. Also, we compare and contrast LEAs, Hajek's BL-algebras, and
   the basic algebras of Chajda, Hala, and Kuhr.}},

Abstract = {{We deal with the problem of coexistence in interval effect algebras

   interval effect algebra E, a coexistent subset S of E, a witness mapping
   beta for S, and an element t aaEuro parts per thousand E a-aEuro parts
   per thousand S. We study the question whether there is a witness mapping
   beta (t) for S a(a)aEuro parts per thousand\{t\} such that beta (t) is
   an extension of beta. In the main result, we prove that such an
   extension exists if and only if there is a mapping e (t) from finite
   subsets of S to E satisfying certain conditions. The main result is then
   applied several times to prove claims of the type ``If t has a
   such-and-such relationship to S and beta, then beta (t) exists{''}.}},

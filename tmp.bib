abstract="For an effect algebra A, we examine the category of all morphisms from finite Boolean algebras into A. This category can be described as a category of elements of a presheaf R(A) on the category of finite Boolean algebras. We prove that some properties (being an orthoalgebra, the Riesz decomposition property, being a Boolean algebra) of an effect algebra A can be characterized in terms of some properties of the category of elements of the presheaf R(A). We prove that the tensor product of effect algebras arises as a left Kan extension of the free product of finite Boolean algebras along the inclusion functor. The tensor product of effect algebras can be expressed by means of the Day convolution of presheaves on finite Boolean algebras.",
